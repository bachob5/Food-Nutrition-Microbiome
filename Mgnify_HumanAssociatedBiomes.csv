Here we used metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples to identify taxonomic markers that distinguished CRC patients from tumor-free controls in a study population of 156 participants. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved >45% relative to the FOBT while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early and late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control populations (N=335) from different countries. CRC-associated changes in the fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal tumor-related host-microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift from fiber degradation in controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino acids in CRC patients accompanied by an increase of lipopolysaccharide metabolism.",Potential of fecal microbiota for early stage detection of colorectal cancer,SUBMITTED,2023-10-09T15:24:44,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005628/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005628/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system'}}, {'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}, {'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Mammals:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005628/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005628/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005628/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005628/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005628

NGS16S analysis was also performed on DNA extracted directly from patient samples. 96% of all organisms identified were cultivable, but only 21% were reported by standard culture, indicating that standard work-up can be further optimized. Direct NGS16S correlated well with standard culture results, identifying the same predominant organism in 50% of samples. When different predominant organisms were identified, NGS16S most often detected anaerobes, whose growth is unsupported by standard culture conditions. Brucella agar was the best single value-added media, supporting the growth of the largest number of organisms for the most specimens. Anaerobes are underappreciated BAL constituents. NGS16S identifies more organisms per sample and allows identification of fastidious organisms, while culture is better at capturing organisms when bacterial load is low, and allows incidental recovery of non-bacterial pathogens such as yeast or molds. Molecular and culture-based methods together detect more relevant organisms in clinical samples than either method alone.",Augmentation of Standard Clinical Microbiological Culture with Next Generation Sequencing Improves Diagnosis in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Specimens,HARVESTED,2023-09-26T09:54:58,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006527/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006527/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory system:Pulmonary system:Lung', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory%20system:Pulmonary%20system:Lung'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006527/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006527/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006527/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006527/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006527

Importantly, they pose a natural threshold to colonization with pathogenic bacteria by direct competition. Here we show that acute infection of the lung with influenza A viruses causes elimination of a substantial proportion of bacteria from the small intestine. This weakens the natural shield against pathogenic bacteria and renders the intestinal epithelium vulnerable for invading bacteria. We further show that influenza A virus infection up-regulates the activity of Paneth cells a major source of antimicrobial peptides in the small intestine. This suggests that influenza A viruses affect a host mechanism of microbiota regulation to cause bacterial depletion in the small intestine. Surprisingly, the same mechanism does not apply in the respiratory tract, where influenza A virus infection causes subtle qualitative but not quantitative changes in the commensal microbiota.

Alterations in the composition of the lung microbiome, known as dysbiosis, have been associated with lung disease and in particular may play a functional role in disease severity and exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The AERIS study (Acute Exacerbation and Respiratory Infections in COPD; GSK Study 114378; NCT01360398) provides a unique opportunity to observe dynamic changes in the lung microbiome and associated biomarkers in a cohort of 127 COPD patients, who were followed monthly and within 72 h of exacerbation onset over two years. We surveyed 584 sputum samples from 104 patients to analyze the lung microbiome at both stable and exacerbation time points in the first year of the study via 16S rRNA sequencing. We obtained a mean of 5.7 samples per subject, 2.1 of which were collected during an exacerbation event. Ranking subjects by GOLD status showed a significant decrease in entropy of the microbiome (Shannon diversity index) and an increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, such as Haemophilus, with an increase in disease severity. The genus with the most significant increase between stable and exacerbation events was Moraxella. Exacerbations with different phenotypes (containing bacterial pathogens detected by culture compared to eosinophils in sputum) had significantly distinct ratios of Proteobacteria to Firmicutes. Moreover, using a Markov chain analysis of exacerbation phenotypes, we found that bacterial and eosinophilic but not viral exacerbations were more likely to be repeated in subsequent exacerbations within a subject. Markov chain analysis also revealed that bacterial exacerbations containing Haemophilus influenzae (Hi, mostly nontypeable) had an increased probability of repeating relative to bacterial (e.g. Moraxella) exacerbations without Hi. Finally, we analyzed the temporal stability of the lung microbiome within each subject and found that microbiome composition in both stable and exacerbation states became more variable in patients experiencing exacerbations during the year. Patients with bronchiectasis showed notably more stability in microbiome composition, which was characterized by a high proportion of Haemophilus relative to that in patients without bronchiectasis. These findings improve our understanding of lung microbiome behavior over time in COPD, providing insight into our ability to use dysbiosis as a biomarker in COPD classification and establishing for the first time infective and inflammatory longitudinal phenotypes that may be used to guide future therapeutic strategies.",GlaxoSmithKline - UofSouthampton - AERIS COPD Lung Microbiome,HARVESTED,2023-09-12T10:55:51,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006478/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006478/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory system:Pulmonary system:Lung', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory%20system:Pulmonary%20system:Lung'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006478/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006478/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006478/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006478/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006478

The early establishment of the gut microflora is suspected to have a particularly profound impact protecting the gut from infectious disease and on long-term subsequent health by predisposing individuals to atopic or autoimmune disease later in life. In contrast to the large-scale efforts of the Human Microbiome Project to characterize the microbial flora of healthy adults, relatively little has been accomplished to characterize the early establishment of the microbiota in infants.  The administration of antibiotics to infants has the capacity to profoundly affect the early acquisition, establishment, and natural maturation of commensal microflora. Prematurity is another major factor that is thought to influence 'normal' gut microbial composition in early life. A high number of pre-term infants receive antibiotic therapy prophylactically; the immediate and long-term effects of antibiotic treatment on infant and later health outcomes are unknown. We hypothesize that gestational age influences the ability to support 'normal' gut microbiota, and that antibiotic administration in the first few weeks of life can alter or delay the development of a 'normal' microbiota and may lead to adverse health outcomes. If we hope to promote the healthy establishment of early gut colonization and thereby improve health outcomes, we need to establish what 'normal' colonization looks like across gestational ages and apply this knowledge as a benchmark to understand the impact of antibiotic treatment in early postnatal life.  In this project, we propose to examine the microbiome in four cohorts ranging from extremely preterm to term, with birth weights appropriate for gestational age: Group 1) 23 to 27 weeks and extremely low birth weight [ELBW, <1000 grams]; Group 2) 28 to 32 weeks and very low birth weight [VLBW, >1000 to <1500 grams]; Group 3) 33 to 36 weeks and low birth weight [LBW, >1500 to <2500 grams]; and Group 4) term (37 to 42 weeks) and normal [>2500 to <4000 gram] birth weight.

Yet, chronic infections continue to significantly impact morbidity and mortality in CF. Over time, the microbial epidemiology has changed, with a rise of filamentous fungi and yeast recovered by culture from the CF respiratory tract. The pressures of cumulative and chronic exposure to antibiotics in the course of CF likely contributes to the observed changes in fungal detection.Conventional culture-based detection methods are the primary modality to identify microorganisms in CF sputum. However, the adoption of DNA sequence-based analyses has greatly expanded our understanding of bacterial diversity in CF. Unbiased 16S rRNA gene sequencing of CF respiratory samples have yielded insight into age-specific bacterial diversity and resiliency of the bacterial community during pulmonary exacerbations.

However, the dynamics of the lung microbiome during COPD exacerbations and its potential role in disease aetiology remains poorly understood. We completed a longitudinal 16S ribosomal RNA survey of the lung microbiome on 476 sputum samples collected from 87 subjects with COPD at four visits defined as stable state, exacerbation, two weeks post therapy and six weeks recovery. Our analysis revealed a dynamic lung microbiota where changes appeared to be associated with exacerbation events and indicative of specific exacerbation phenotypes. Antibiotic and steroid treatments appear to have differential effects on the lung microbiome. We depict a microbial interaction network for the lung microbiome and suggest that perturbation of a few bacterial operational taxonomic units, in particular Haemophilus spp, could greatly impact the overall microbial community structure. Furthermore, several serum and sputum biomarkers, in particular sputum interleukin-8 (IL-8), appear to be highly correlated with the structure and diversity of the microbiome.

Ten transplant recipients from a separate transplant centre provided samples pre/post-anti-reflux Nissen fundoplication surgery. Microbial community composition and density were measured using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR, respectively and inflammatory markers and bile acids were quantified.Measurements and Main Results: We observed three community composition profiles (labelled community state types, CSTs 1-3). Transplant recipients with GERD were more likely to have CST1, characterized by high bacterial density and relative abundance of the oropharyngeal colonizing genera Prevotella and Veillonella. GERD was associated with more frequent transition to CST1. CST1 was associated with lower per-bacteria inflammatory cytokine levels than the pathogen-dominated CST3. Time-dependant models revealed associations between CST3 and development of ALAD/CLAD. Nissen fundoplication decreased bacterial load and pro-inflammatory cytokines.Conclusion: GERD was associated with a high density, Prevotella/Veillonella dominated CST1. CST3, but not CST1 or GERD, was associated with inflammation and early development of ALAD/CLAD. Nissen fundoplication was associated with decreases in microbial density in BALF samples, especially the CST1-specific genus, Prevotella.","Gastroesophageal reflux disease is associated with differences in the allograft microbiome, microbial density and inflammation in lung transplantation.",HARVESTED,2023-09-03T00:35:06,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006385/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006385/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory system:Pulmonary system:Lung', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory%20system:Pulmonary%20system:Lung'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006385/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006385/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006385/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006385/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006385

Besides fighting infections, antibiotics also alter the gut microbiota. Commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract are crucial to maintain immune homeostasis, and microbial imbalance or dysbiosis affects disease susceptibility and progression. We hypothesized that antibiotic-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota would suppress cytokine profiles in the host, thereby leading to changes in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, dysbiosis resulted in alterations in bacterial abundance, composition and diversity. On the host side, antibiotic-induced dysbiosis caused elongated small intestines and ceca, and B16-F10 melanoma and Lewis Lung carcinoma progressed more quickly than in orthobiotic control mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that this progression was mediated by suppressed TNF-a levels, both locally and systemically, resulting in reduced expression of tumor endothelial adhesion molecules, particularly intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and a subsequent decrease in the number of activated CD8+ T-cells in the tumor. However, suppression of ICAM-1 or its binding site, the alpha subunit of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, was not seen in the spleen or thymus during dysbiosis. TNF-a supplementation in dysbiotic mice was able to increase ICAM-1 expression and leukocyte trafficking into the tumor. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of commensal bacteria in supporting anti-cancer immune surveillance, define an important role of tumor endothelial cells within this process, and suggest adverse consequences of antibiotics on distal cancer development.

Chronic airway infection and inflammation culminating in bronchiectasis are the main drivers of the morbidity and mortality of CF 1. There is good evidence these processes start early in life, with asymptomatic infants and pre-school children demonstrating clear associations between the presence of lower airway infection and inflammation and impaired lung function and structural airway changes 1,2.The use of 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing provides compelling evidence that CF airways are inhabited by diverse microbial communities 3-7. Perturbations in the CF airway microbiome are well described, however it is unclear what affect these have on the “infection-inflammation-structural damage” model of CF lung disease 3-12. Limited studies in young children with CF suggest microbial diversity is initially low but increases with age 3,7,9,11,12. In contrast, in older children and adults, diversity decreases with age and declining lung function 3,7,13,14. In adults, with advancing lung disease and repeated exposure to antibiotics over an extended period of time, dominant CF pathogens emerge in a relatively fixed microbiome with limited diversity 4,6,15,16.We aimed to describe the lower airway microbiome in clinically stable pre-school aged children with CF, and, using longitudinal data, explore how age influences its composition.

How best to sample the respiratory tract in children for microbiota analysis, and the utility of microbiota profiling in clinical management of early infection remains unclear. By comparison with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), we assessed the ability of induced sputum (IS) sampling to characterise the lower airway microbiota. Methods: Sample sets from IS and two or three matched BAL compartments were obtained for microbiota analysis as part of the CF-Sputum Induction Trial (UKCRN_14615, ISRCTNR_12473810). Microbiota profiles and pathogen detection were compared between matched samples. Results: Twenty-eight patients, aged 1.1–17.7 years, provided 30 sample sets. Within-patient BAL comparisons revealed spatial heterogeneity in 8/30 (27%) sample sets indicating that the lower airway microbiota from BAL is frequently compartmentalised in children with CF. IS samples closely resembled one or more matched BAL compartments in 15/30 (50%) sets, and were related in composition in a further 9/30 (30%). IS detected 86.2% of the Top 5 genera found across matched BAL samples. The sensitivity of IS to detect specific CF-pathogens identified in matched BAL samples at relative abundance ≥5% varied between 43 and 100%, with negative predictive values between 73 and 100%. Conclusions: Spatial heterogeneity of the lower airway microbiota was observed in BAL samples and presents difficulties for consistent lung sampling. IS captured a microbiota signature representative of the lower airway in 80% of cases, and is a straightforward, non-invasive intervention that can be performed frequently to aid pathogen diagnosis and understand microbiota evolution in children with CF.",The lung microbiota in children with cystic fibrosis captured by induced sputum sampling,SUBMITTED,2023-09-01T15:25:24,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006274/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006274/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory system:Pulmonary system:Lung', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory%20system:Pulmonary%20system:Lung'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006274/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006274/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006274/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006274/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006274

The newest of these, Trikafta (TKT), is a triple therapy utilizing Ivacaftor, a CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator, combined with Tezacaftor and Elexacaftor, CFTR correctors. However, it is not yet known how these drugs will affect polymicrobial lung infections, which are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people with CF (pwCF). Here, we analyzed the sputum microbiome and metabolome from pwCF (n=24) before and after TKT therapy using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. The lung microbiome diversity, particularly its evenness, was increased (p = 0.044) and the microbiome profiles were different between individuals before and after therapy (PERMANOVA F=1.92, p=0.044). Despite these changes, the microbiomes were more similar within an individual than across the sampled population. There were no specific microbial taxa that were different in abundance before and after therapy, but collectively, the log-ratio of anaerobes to pathogens significantly decreased. The sputum metabolome also showed changes due to TKT. Beta-diversity increased after therapy (PERMANOVA F=4.22, p=0.022) and was characterized by greater variation across subjects while on treatment. This significant difference in the metabolome was driven by a decrease in peptides, amino acids, and metabolites from the kynurenine pathway. Metabolism of the three small molecules that make up TKT was extensive, including previously uncharacterized structural modifications. This study shows that TKT therapy affects both the microbiome and metabolome of airway mucus. This effect was stronger on sputum biochemistry, which may reflect changing niche spaces for microbial residency in lung mucus as the drug’s effects take hold, which then leads to changing microbiology.Why: exploratory study, not much is known about TRIKAFTA’s impact on microbiome/metabolome of CF lung Method: acquired samples pre- and post-TRIKAFTA intervention from 2 clinics for a total of 20 (subject to change) patients; 16S metagenomics (DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing, analysis); metabolomics (methanol prep, LC-MS, analysis)",A multiomics study on the effects of TRIKAFTA on CF patients,SUBMITTED,2023-08-05T21:13:35,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006279/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006279/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory system:Pulmonary system:Sputum', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Respiratory%20system:Pulmonary%20system:Sputum'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006279/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006279/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006279/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006279/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00006279

No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota in PBB A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community composition (R2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed between controls and patients. Bacterial communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with the patient group.  In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not identified by standard routine clinical culture.The bacteria present in the lungs of patients with PBB were less diverse in terms of richness and evenness.

Objectives: To comprehensively define lung microbiota composition during stable disease and exacerbation in bronchiectasis patients using both strict anaerobic culture and massively parallel pyrosequencing. Methods: Sputum was collected from bronchietasis patients when clinically stable and before and after completion of antibiotic treatment of pulmonary exacerbations. Bacterial abundance and community composition were analyzed using culture and 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. Measurements and Main Results: In clinically stable patients, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were detected in 40/40 (100%) and 33/40 (83%) sputum samples, respectively. The dominant organisms cultured were P. aeruginosa (n=10 patients), H. influenzae (n=12), S. aureus(n=6), Prevotella (n=18) and Veillonella (n=13). Pyrosequencing generated over 150,000 sequences, representing 113 distinct microbial taxa; the majority of observed community richness resulted from taxa present in low abundance with similar patterns of phyla distribution in clinically stable patients and patients at the onset of exacerbation. Following antibiotic treatment of exacerbation, there was no change in total (p=0.925), aerobic(p=0.917) or anaerobic (p=0.683) viable counts and only a limited shift in community composition. There was also no correlation between lung function and microbial community diversity (ρ=0.123, p=0.549). Conclusions: A complex microbiota is present in the lungs of patients with bronchiectasis.

Background: Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder with unknown etiology. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbial community present in the urine from IC female patients and compare this with the microbial profile of asymptomatic healthy female (HF) urine. Results: The composition and distribution of bacterial sequences differed between the urine microbiota of IC and HF. Reduced sequence richness and diversity were found for IC patient urine, and a significant difference in the community structure of IC urine in relation to HF urine was observed. More than 90% of the IC sequence reads were identified as belonging to the bacterial genus Lactobacillus, a marked increase compared to the 60% in the HF urine. Conclusion: The 16S rDNA sequence data demonstrates a shift in the bacterial composition of IC urine. The reduced microbial diversity and richness is accompanied by a higher abundance of the bacterial genus Lactobacillus, compared to HF urine.

Protein and fat content in composed diet was 1.5 times higher compared to that in average diet of normal weight group, while carbohydrate content was 2 times lower. Total fiber content was comparable to normal weight group. Food consumption data were obtained from assigned meals. Database of specific fiber composition of different food categories was developed and macronutrient, total and specific fiber consumption were calculated. Microbial composition was analysed before and after the intervention from 2 sequential samples by 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS:During intervention BMI reduced in average 2.5 ± 0.6 kg/m2 and stool frequency was normalized. Assigned diet induced significant changes in fecal microbiota.

High-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was used to characterize the fecal microbiota before and after four weeks of daily probiotic cells consumption.  This work shows that the intake of one billion live B. bifidum BB cells affects the relative abundance of dominant taxa in the fecal microbiota and modulates the fecal levels of butyrate. Specifically the relative abundance of family Prevotellaceae (P=0.041) and genus Prevotella (P=0.034) was significantly decreased, whereas the relative abundance of families Ruminococcaceae (P=0.039) and Rikenellaceae (P=0.010) was significantly increased. Although the overall composition of the microbiota was not affected, the dependency of the probiotic intervention on the enterotype has been highlighted observing the major effects of BB on microbiota composition in the Prevotella-dominated enterotype rather than the Bacteroides-dominated one.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a single daily administration of B. bifidum BB can modify the human intestinal microbial ecology in healthy (not diseased) adults in a significant fashion.

Aging is characterized by increased systemic low-grade inflammation, altered gut microbiota composition and enhanced intestinal permeability (IP). The intake of polyphenol-rich (PR) foods is proposed as a promising strategy to positively affect the gut microbiota-immune system-intestinal barrier (IB) axis. In this context, the MaPLE project was designed to test the hypothesis that a PR dietary pattern may preserve and/or improve IB function in older people. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the dietary intervention might have affected the presence of bacterial factors in the bloodstream of the older volunteers participating in the MaPLE trial. Methods and results. We quantified the presence of bacterial DNA in blood by qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene (16S; bacterial DNAemia). Blood DNA was  taxonomically profiled via 16S sequencing. We found that higher blood 16S levels are associated to higher BMI and markers of IP, inflammation and dyslipidemia. Subjects with higher bacterial DNAemia could benefit more from the PR-dietary intervention as demonstrated by the reduction of the markers related to IP, inflammation and dyslipidemia. Finally, we found that the bacterial DNA detected in blood mostly belong to γ-Proteobacteria, whose abundance significantly decreased after the PR-diet in subjects with higher bacterial DNAemia at baseline.Conclusion. This study shows that the efficacy of the PR diet could depend on bacterial DNAemia.

It is well now known that altered microflora can lead to the development of various diseases, including malignancies. One of the ways in which these processes in the body are potentially influenced by the microflora is through extracellular vesicles (EVs) and the RNA content in them, but currently research methods for these processes are limited. Classical in vitro methods cannot mimic the entry of the microbiome EV from the intestinal lumen into the circulatory system, but animal models do not fully reflect the processes in the human body and are ethically questionable models for these studies. One of the most promising methods currently in microflora research is the gut on chip (GoC) platform, however so far, the available solution has not been applied and designed for the study of the microbiome EV content. Therefore, the aim of this project is to study EV RNA content of cancer patient microbiome, that can enter from lumen to circulation by applying GoC devices already developed in a collaboration between BMC and ISSP.

To query virus-host interactions of the skin, we performed parallel metagenomic sequencing and an integrated analysis of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) and total microbial communities. To assess spatial, interpersonal, and temporal variance, samples were collected from eight anatomical skin sites of 16 healthy individuals over two months. Skin viral communities were dominated by tailed bacteriophages--viruses replicating on human cells were comparatively rare. Similar to the skin whole metagenome, viral community composition and diversity was strongly associated with the microenvironment of the site sampled, and temporal variation within an individual was small compared to differences between individuals. Virome communities were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style, indicating that many infections would be non-lethal to the host and provide an opportunity for gene transfer. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation. Among these, some spacers targeted phage found at different body sites, suggesting that CRISPR spacer acquisition may provide a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities.

The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infants' gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.",Metagenomic sequencing of preterm infant gut microbiota raw sequence reads,HARVESTED,2021-12-02T17:51:56,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005860/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005860/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005860/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005860/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005860/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005860/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005860

However, the temporal variability of the healthy gut microbiome has not yet been studied in depth using metagenomics and little is known about the effects of different sampling and preservation approaches. We performed metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from seven subjects collected over a period of up to two years to investigate temporal variability and assess preservation-induced variation, specifically, fresh frozen compared to RNALater. We also monitored short-term disturbances caused by antibiotic treatment and bowel cleansing in one subject.Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time-points, samples from the same subject clustered together, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where, more than one year after the treatment, samples did not resemble the pre-treatment state. Clustering was not affected by preservation method. No species differed significantly in abundance, and only 0.36% of gene families were differentially abundant between preservation methods. Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, which in turn is much smaller than the observed between-subject variability. Thus, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies.",Temporal and technical variability of human gut metagenomes,SUBMITTED,2021-10-17T23:23:37,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005817/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005817/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005817/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005817/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005817/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005817/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005817

Based on well-established workflows, we evaluated the influence of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified, lab-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal sample.Although bioinformatic pipelines contributed to variability in peptide identification, wet-lab stages were the most important source of differences between analyses. Moreover, protein groups were less sensitive to those differences than peptides. Comparing taxonomic and functional profiles revealed differences between peptide- and protein-centric approaches at the taxonomic level but very similar functional profiles.These CAMPI findings present the current opportunities and challenges in metaproteomics research and provide a perspective for future benchmarking studies.",Critical Assessment of Metaproteome Investigation (CAMPI): a Multi-Lab Comparison of Established Workflows,SUBMITTED,2021-03-31T16:25:26,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005729/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005729/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Engineered:Modeled:Simulated communities (microbial mixture)', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Engineered:Modeled:Simulated%20communities%20(microbial%20mixture)'}}, {'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005729/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005729/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005729/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005729/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005729

Until now, only little is known about PD-associated changes in gut microbiota composition and their implication in PD development. Due to variance in previously published reports about the differences between community composition in PD and non-PD patients, our intention is to increase knowledge in this field with the use of two next generation sequencing (NGS) methods (Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM) on the same set of samples.

Given that strongyles inhabit the same niche as the gut microbiota, they may interact with each other. These beneficial or detrimental interactions are unknown in horses and could partly explain contrasted susceptibility to infection between individuals. To address these questions, an experimental pasture trial with 20 worm-free female Welsh ponies (10 susceptible (S) and 10 resistant (R) to parasite infection) was implemented for 5 months. Fecal egg counts (FEC), hematological and biochemical data, body weight and gut microbiological composition were studied in each individual after 0, 24, 43, 92 and 132 grazing days. R and S ponies displayed divergent immunological profiles and slight differences in microbiological composition under worm-free conditions. After exposure to natural infection, the predicted R ponies exhibited lower FEC after 92 and 132 grazing days, and maintained higher levels of circulating monocytes and eosinophils, while lymphocytosis persisted in S ponies. Although the overall gut microbiota diversity and structure remained similar during the parasite infection between the two groups, S ponies exhibited a reduction of bacteria such as Ruminococcus, Clostridium XIVa and members of the Lachnospiraceae family, which may have promoted a disruption of mucosal homeostasis at day 92. In line with this hypothesis, an increase in pathobionts such as Pseudomonas and Campylobacter together with changes in several predicted immunological pathways, including pathogen sensing, lipid metabolism, and activation of signal transduction that are critical for the regulation of immune system and energy homeostasis were observed in S relative to R ponies. Moreover, S ponies displayed an increase in protozoan concentrations at day 92, suggesting that strongyles and protozoa may contribute to each others success in the equine intestines. It could also be that S individuals favor the increase of these carbohydrate-degrading microorganisms to enhance the supply of nutrients needed to fight strongyle infection. Overall, this study provides a foundation to better understand the mechanisms that underpin the relationship between equines and natural strongyle infection.

We used a metagenomic assembly and binning approach to recover metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the supragingival plaque and tongue dorsum of healthy individuals, and used long-read sequencing to associate TM7 MAGs with previously identified phylotypes through 16S rRNA sequence comparison. Our genomes represent prevalent and abundant lineages that lack genomic representation in the HOMD and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) genomic databases, including members of the Candidate Phyla Radiation. Using a multi-omics approach we show that oral TM7 species are split into plaque and tongue specialists, and that plaque TM7 phylogenetically and functionally associate with environmental TM7, while tongue TM7 associate with TM7 from animal guts. To assess the generality of our results we carried out read recruitment from approximately 200 tongue and 200 plaque Human Microbiome Project (HMP) samples; which confirm that the genomes we identified are prevalent, abundant, and site-specific. Our findings suggest that at least for TM7, dental plaque resembles non-host habitats, while tongue- and gut-associated TM7s are more strongly shaped by the host.

We show that pairwise interactions are major drivers of multi-species community dynamics, as opposed to higher-order interactions. The inferred ecological network exhibits a high proportion of negative and frequent positive interactions. Ecological drivers and responsive recipient species were discovered in the network. Our model demonstrated that a prevalent positive and negative interaction topology enables robust coexistence by implementing a negative feedback loop that balances disparities in monospecies fitness levels. We show that negative interactions could generate history-dependent responses of initial species proportions that frequently do not originate from bistability.

Treatment has been limited by a lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Stunting is most likely associated with changes in the microbial community of the small intestine, a compartment vital for digestion and nutrient absorption. Efforts to better understand the pathophysiology have been hampered by difficulty of access to small intestinal fluids. Here, we describe for the first time the microbial community found in the upper gastrointestinal tract of stunted children. We studied 46 duodenal and 57 gastric samples from stunted children as well as 404 fecal samples from stunted and non-stunted children aged 2-5 years living in Bangui, Central African Republic and in Antananarivo, Madagascar, using 16S Illumina Amplicon sequencing and semi-quantitative culture methods. The vast majority of the stunted children showed small intestinal bacterial overgrowth dominated by bacteria that normally reside in the oropharyngeal cavity. There was an overrepresentation of oral bacteria in fecal samples of stunted children opening the way for developing non-invasive diagnostic markers. In addition, E. coli/Shigella sp. and Campylobacter sp. were found to be more prevalent in stunted children, while Clostridia, well-known butyrate producers, were reduced. Our data suggest that stunting is associated with a microbiome decompartmentalization of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by an increased presence of oropharyngeal bacteria from the stomach to the colon, hence challenging the current view of stunting arising solely as a consequence of small intestine overstimulation through recurrent infections by enteric pathogens.",Stunted childhood growth is associated with decompartmentalization of the gastrointestinal tract and overgrowth of oropharyngeal taxa,SUBMITTED,2020-06-14T15:01:53,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005526

We have previously demonstrated a significant association between the placental microbiome and risk of preterm birth, as well as (in non-pregnant subjects) association of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants (mtSNPs) with the vaginal and gut microbiome. In this study, we aimed to explore complex interactions between human host mtSNPs and the vaginal and placental membrane microbiome with associated risk of preterm birth.Methods: Maternal blood and placental tissue samples from 93 gravidae (n=54 with preterm deliveries between 23 and 0/7 and <37 and 0/7 weeks; n=39 term =37 and 0/7 weeks) were deep sequenced, and mtSNPs were called with high confidence. The microbial taxonomic abundance of the vagina (introitus and posterior fornix) and placental membranes (maternal and fetal side swabs) from the same subjects were obtained via 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, and inferred metagenomics was employed for metabolic pathway analysis. Interactions among both microbial taxa and their inferred metagenomics pathways were examined for association with mtSNPs employing multiple linear regressions modeling for both genotype and clinical covariates with PLINK quantitative trait associations. Analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons, with a q value <0.05 denoting significance.Results: Consistent with ours and others recent published observations, we observed an association between preterm birth and the composition of the placental membrane microbiome community (PERMANOVA p=0.042). In our cohort, no significant association between any mtSNP with the occurrence of preterm birth was observed. However, overall associations between mitochondrial genome variations and both the vaginal and placental membrane preterm microbial community were observed. Of note, several functional mtSNPs (within coding regions for electron transport genes) demonstrated significant and robust associations (q value <0.05) with both occurrence and abundance of certain taxa and their metagenomics pathways among preterm births.Conclusions: We have demonstrated for the first time that maternally inherited human mtSNPs are associated with variations in both placental membrane and vaginal microbial taxa membership and their inferred metabolic function during pregnancy, and consequentially linked to the occurrence of preterm birth.",Integrated Analysis of mtDNA Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms with the Vaginal and Placental Membrane Microbiome and Rendered Risk Estimation for Preterm Birth,HARVESTED,2020-06-14T13:37:08,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005527

These adjacent regions show one of the most contrasting socio-economical differences in the world.OBJECTIVE:We explored changes in allergy from school age to young adulthood from 2003 to 2010/2012 in these two areas. The skin and nasal microbiota were also compared.METHODS:Randomly selected children from Finnish (n = 98) and Russian Karelia (n = 82) were examined in 2003, when the children were 7-11 years of age, and again in 2010 (Finnish Karelia) and 2012 (Russian Karelia). We analysed self-reported allergy symptoms and sensitization to common allergens by serum sIgE values. The skin (volar forearm) and nasal mucosa microbiota, collected in 2012 (aged 15-20 years), identified from DNA samples, were compared with multivariate methods.RESULTS:Asthma, hay fever, atopic eczema, self-reported rhinitis, as well as atopic sensitization, were threefold to 10-fold more common in Finland, as compared to Russian Karelia. Hay fever and peanut sensitization were almost non-existent in Russia. These patterns remained throughout the 10-year follow-up. Skin microbiota, as well as bacterial and fungal communities in nasal mucosa, was contrastingly different between the populations, best characterized by the diversity and abundance of genus Acinetobacter; more abundant and diverse in Russia. Overall, diversity was significantly higher among Russian subjects (Pskin < 0.0001, Pnasal-bacteria < 0.0001 and Pnasal-fungi < 0.01). Allergic diseases were not associated with microbial diversity in Finnish subjects.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:Differences in allergic phenotype, developed in early life, remain between populations. A parallel difference in the composition of skin and nasal microbiota suggests a potential underlying mechanism. Our results also suggest that high abundance and diversity of Acinetobacter might contribute to the low allergy prevalence in Russia.

Human population surveys have demonstrated that gut microbial resistomes reflect local antibiotics usage patterns, while previous small cohort studies based on single antibiotic exposures have shown varying degrees of antibiotic impact on the gut microbiota and their associated resistome. However, the role of resistomes of particular gut species in their ability to persist in the face of antibiotic treatment has not been systematically studied.Applying shotgun sequencing and quantitative metagenomics, we analyzed the partial eradication and subsequent regrowth of gut microbiota in 12 healthy young men over a 6 month period following a 4-day intervention with three broad-spectrum antibiotics. The gut microbial communities of the study subjects underwent profound compositional changes due to the treatment but slowly recovered to near-baseline compositions. Immediately after the treatment, the gut microbiota featured an increased relative abundance of opportunistic and proinflammatory bacterial species, and a decreased relative abundance of short chain fatty acid producers, while exhibiting an increased functional potential for multidrug efflux pumps and virulence factors. These enrichment trends were weaker after 8 days and mostly cleared out after 42 days. However, 9 common intestinal commensal species found at baseline and associated with short chain fatty production or efficient digestion of polysaccharides remained undetectable in most of the subjects even after 180 days.Carrying genes that confer resistance to the antibiotics used in this multidrug study had specific consequences for the survival and de novo colonization potential of microbial species. While species harboring beta-lactam resistance genes were positively selected during and after the intervention, those harboring glycopeptide or aminoglycoside resistance exhibited increased odds of de novo colonization but decreased odds of survival. Despite a mild long-lasting imprint following exposure to three antibiotics, the gut microbiota of healthy young adults are resilient to a broad-spectrum antibiotic intervention, and their recovery process is modulated by antibiotic resistance gene carriage.",Gut resistome modulates resilience and recovery of gut microbiota after broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment,SUBMITTED,2020-05-28T18:09:50,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005516/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005516/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005516/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005516/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005516/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005516/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005516

Evidence is accumulating that this program is disrupted in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and that their persistent gut microbiota immaturity, which is not durably repaired with current ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) interventions, is causally related to disease pathogenesis. To further characterize gut microbial community development in healthy versus malnourished infants/children, we performed a time-series metagenomic study of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) recovered from fecal samples collected during the first 30 months of postnatal life from eight pairs of mono- and dizygotic Malawian twins concordant for healthy growth, and 12 twin pairs discordant for SAM (either marasmus or kwashiorkor). Both members of discordant pairs were sampled just prior to, during and after treatment with a peanut-based RUTF. Using Random Forests and a dataset of 17,676 viral contigs assembled from shotgun sequencing reads of VLP DNAs, we identified viruses that distinguish different assembly stages of the gut microbiota in the concordant healthy twin pairs. This normal developmental program was impaired in both members of SAM discordant pairs and not repaired with RUTF. Phage plus viruses belonging to the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae families of single-stranded eukaryotic viruses discriminate  discordant pairs from concordant healthy pairs. These results disclose that apparently healthy co-twins in discordant pairs have viromes indicative of familial risk for SAM and provide a human model for delineating normal versus perturbed postnatal acquisition and retention of the gut microbiotas viral component in populations at risk for malnutrition.",The gut DNA viromes of Malawian twins discordant for severe acute undernutrition,SUBMITTED,2020-05-21T21:59:24,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005394/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005394/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005394/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005394/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005394/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005394/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005394

Dissection of a culture collection of 11 IgA-targeted strains from an undernourished donor, sufficient to transmit these phenotypes, disclosed that Enterobacteriaceae interacted with other consortium members to produce enteropathy.

However, there has been no information on the gut metagenome configuration in hunter-gatherer populations, posing a gap in our knowledge of gut microbiota (GM)-host mutualism arising from a lifestyle that describes over 90% of human evolutionary history. Here, we present the first metagenomic analysis of GM from Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, showing a unique enrichment in metabolic pathways that align with the dietary and environmental factors characteristic of their foraging lifestyle. We found that the Hadza GM is adapted for broad spectrum carbohydrate metabolism, reflecting the complex polysaccharides in their diet. Furthermore, the Hadza GM is equipped for branched-chain amino acid degradation and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis.

Interactions between the gut microbiome and fecal bile acid composition as a factor in colorectal cancer neoplasia have been postulated but evidence is limited to small cohorts and animal studies. Using banked stool samples collected as part of a phase III randomized clinical trial of UDCA for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we compared change in the microbiome composition after a 3-year intervention in a subset of participants randomized to oral UDCA at 8-10 mg/kg of body weight per day (n = 198) or placebo (n = 203). Study participants randomized to UDCA experienced compositional changes in their microbiome that were statistically more similar to other individuals in the UDCA arm than to those in the placebo arm. This reflected a UDCA-associated shift in microbial community composition (P < 0.001), independent of sex, with no evidence of a UDCA effect on microbial richness (P > 0.05). These UDCA-associated shifts in microbial community distance metrics from baseline to end-of-study were not associated with risk of any or advanced adenoma (all P > 0.05) in men or women. Separate analyses of microbial networks revealed an overrepresentation of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the post-UDCA arm and an inverse relationship between F prausnitzii and Ruminococcus gnavus. In men who received UDCA, the overrepresentation of F prausnitzii and underrepresentation of R gnavus were more prominent in those with no adenoma recurrence at follow-up compared to men with recurrence. This relationship was not observed in women. Daily UDCA use modestly influences the relative abundance of microbial species in stool and affects the microbial network composition with suggestive evidence for sex-specific effects of UDCA on stool microbial community composition as a modifier of colorectal adenoma risk.[This text is derived from our Open Access publication of the same title as this project.]",Effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on the gut microbiome and colorectal adenoma development.,HARVESTED,2020-05-02T02:23:31,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005198

To more accurately diagnose health conditions, medical practitioners could benefit from a molecular, culture-independent assay for the quantification of these microorganisms in the context of a healthy reference range. Here we present the targeted sequencing of the microbial 16S rRNA gene of clinically relevant gut microorganisms as a method to provide a gut screening test that could assist in the clinical diagnosis of certain health conditions. We evaluated the possibility of detecting 46 clinical prokaryotic targets in the human gut, 28 of which could be identified with high precision and sensitivity by a bioinformatics pipeline that includes sequence analysis and taxonomic annotation. These targets included 20 commensal, 3 beneficial (probiotic), and 5 pathogenic intestinal microbial taxa. Using stool microbiome samples from a cohort of 897 healthy individuals, we established a reference range defining clinically relevant relative levels for each of the 28 targets.

However, specific microbes or microbial communities that can be mechanistically linked to cervical carcinogenesis remain largely unexplored. The purpose of the study was to examine the association between cervical microbiota and high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2+) in women infected with high-risk (HR) human papillomaviruses (HPV) and to assess whether the cervical microbiota are associated with oxidative DNA damage as indicated by the presence of cervical cells positive for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. The study included 340 women diagnosed with CIN 2+ (cases) and 90 diagnosed with CIN 1 (non-cases). Microbiota composition was determined by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplified from DNA extracted from cervical mucus samples. Measures of alpha/beta-diversity were not associated with either CIN severity or oxidative DNA damage. However, a cervical mucosal community type (CT) dominated by L. iners and unclassified Lactobacillus spp. was associated with CIN 2+ (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.279.55). Sequence reads mapping to Lactobacillaceae, Lactobacillus, L. reuteri, and several subgenus level Lactobacillus operational taxonomic units were also associated with CIN 2+ when examined independently (effect size >2.0; P < 0.05). Our 16S rRNA sequencing results need confirmation in independent studies using whole-genome shotgun sequencing and that would allow sharpening the suggested associations at finer taxonomic levels. Our results provide little evidence that DNA oxidative damage mediates the effect of the microbiome on the natural history of HPV infection and CIN severity.

The relationships between the type of nutritional intervention, the gut microbiota, and therapeutic responses are unclear. In the current study, bacterial species whose proportional representation define a healthy gut microbiota as it assembles during the first two postnatal years were identified by applying a machine-learning-based approach to 16S rRNA datasets generated from monthly fecal samples obtained from a birth-cohort of children, living in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh, who exhibited consistently healthy growth. These age-discriminatory bacterial species were incorporated into a model that computes a relative microbiota maturity index and microbiota-for-age Z-score that compare development (defined here as maturation) of a childs fecal microbiota relative to healthy children of similar chronologic age. The model was applied to twins and triplets (to test for associations of these indices with genetic and environmental factors including diarrhea), children with SAM enrolled in a randomized trial of two food interventions, and children with moderate acute malnutrition. Our results indicate that SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity that is only partially ameliorated following two widely used nutritional interventions. Immaturity is also evident in less severe forms of malnutrition and correlates with anthropometric measurements. Microbiota maturity indices provide a microbial measure of human postnatal development, a way of classifying malnourished states, and a parameter for judging therapeutic efficacy. More prolonged interventions with existing or new therapeutic foods and/or addition of gut microbes may be needed to achieve enduring repair of gut microbiota immaturity in childhood malnutrition and improve clinical outcomes.

The lack of metrics for quantifying development of the gut microbiota and mucosal immune system has hindered the ability to dissect the effects of microbial, host and environmental factors on their co-development. Therefore, we subjected fecal samples, collected monthly during the first 3 postnatal years from 40 healthy USA twin pairs, to bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and to fluorescence-activated cell sorting to distinguish IgA-targeted from non-targeted taxa. Applying a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forests), we identified a set of 25 age-discriminatory bacterial taxa whose patterns of representation define a program of microbiota assembly/maturation shared across twin pairs. Remarkably, IgA responses to 30 taxa, including a subset of the age-discriminatory organisms, converge on a pattern shared across twin pairs by the second postnatal year; the observed targeting patterns were not simple reflections of relative abundance or taxonomy. Zygosity, delivery mode, and breast versus formula feeding had small albeit statistically significant effects on targeting. In follow-up studies, young germ-free mice were colonized with fecal microbiota obtained from two twin pairs at 6 and 18 months of age, and fed a sequence of human diets designed to simulate the transition from milk feeding to complementary foods. Distinct age-associated differences in mucosal IgA responses to the transplanted human microbiota were recapitulated in both diet contexts for both twin pairs, suggesting that intrinsic properties of their community members play a dominant role in dictating IgA responses.  This approach can be used to define gut mucosal immune development in health and disease states, and help identify ways to repair or prevent perturbations in this facet of host immunity.",Characterizing postnatal co-development of the gut microbiota and mucosal IgA responses in healthy twin pairs and a gnotobiotic mouse model,SUBMITTED,2019-12-07T07:43:23,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00005142

Despite great efforts in streamlining the processes of sequencing and data curation, upstream steps required for amplicon library generation could still influence 16S rRNA gene-based microbial profiles. Among upstream processes, DNA extraction is a critical step that could represent a great source of bias. Accounting for bias introduced by extraction procedures is important when comparing studies that use different methods. Identifying the method that best portrays communities is also desirable. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate bias introduced by different DNA extraction procedures on oral microbiome profiles.  Design: Four DNA extraction methods were tested on mock communities consisting of seven representative oral bacteria. Additionally, supragingival plaque samples were collected from 7 individuals and divided equally to test two commonly used DNA extraction procedures. Amplicon libraries of the 16S rRNA gene were generated and sequenced via 454-pyrosequencing.  Results: Evaluation of mock communities revealed that DNA yield and bacterial species representation varied with DNA extraction method. Despite producing the lowest yield of DNA, a method that included bead beating was the only protocol able to detect all seven species in the mock community. Comparison of the performance of two commonly used methods (crude lysis and a chemical/enzymatic lysis + column-based DNA isolation) on plaque samples showed no effect of extraction protocols on taxa prevalence but global community structure and relative abundance of individual taxa were affected. At the phylum level, the latter method improved the recovery of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes over crude lysis.  Conclusion: DNA extraction distorts microbial profiles in simulated and clinical oral samples, reinforcing the importance of careful selection of a DNA extraction protocol to improve species recovery and facilitate data comparison across oral microbiology studies.",Influence of DNA extraction on oral microbial profiles obtained via 16S rRNA gene sequencing- Supragingival plaque,HARVESTED,2019-11-07T16:55:38,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Oral:Subgingival plaque', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Oral:Subgingival%20plaque'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001300

Using longitudinal assessment of saliva and disease status, we demonstrated that partial least squares modelling of microbial, immunological and clinical measures, grouped children according to future dental disease status. Saliva was collected and dental health assessed in 33 children aged 4 years, and again 1-year later. The composition of the salivary microbiome was assessed and host defense peptides in saliva were quantified. Principle component analysis of the salivary microbiome indicated that children clustered by age and not disease status. Similarly, changes in salivary host defense peptides occurred with age and not in response to, or preceding dental caries. Partial least squares modelling of microbial, immunological and clinical baseline measures clustered children according to future dental disease status. These data demonstrate that isolated evaluation of the salivary microbiome or host response failed to predict dental disease.

The effect of such chronic immunosuppression on the microflora at mucosal surfaces is not known. We evaluated the salivary bacterial microbiome of 20 transplant recipients and 19 non-immunosuppressed controls via 454-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Alpha-diversity and global community structure did not differ between transplant and control subjects. However, principal coordinate analysis showed differences in community membership. Taxa more prevalent in transplant subjects included operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of potentially opportunistic Gammaproteobacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Acinetobacter sp., Vibrio spp., Enterobacteriaceae sp. and the genera Acinetobacter and Klebsiella. Transplant subjects had increased proportions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacteriaceae sp. and Enterococcus faecalis, among other OTUs, while increased genera included Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus. Furthermore, in transplant subjects, the dose of the immunosuppressant prednisone positively correlated with bacterial richness, while prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil doses positively correlated with the prevalence and proportions of transplant-associated taxa. Correlation network analysis of OTU relative abundance revealed a cluster containing potentially opportunistic pathogens as transplant-associated. This cluster positively correlated with serum levels of C-reactive protein, suggesting a link between the resident flora at mucosal compartments and systemic inflammation. Network connectivity analysis revealed opportunistic pathogens as highly connected to each other and to common oral commensals, pointing to bacterial interactions that may influence colonization.

Our study endeavors to define the relative abundance of many species comprising the dental plaque microbiome in twin pairs discordant for dental caries in association and longitudinal studies. The study power afforded by the use of discordant twin pairs for dental caries is substantially greater than similar studies using unrelated individuals. Next, we will compare the caries-free and caries-active microbiomes by deep metagenomic sequencing to identify differentially abundant genes and metabolic pathways. Lastly, we will determine the functional relevance of differentially abundant species, strains and genes by conducting targeted meta-transcriptomic studies. The statistical significance of all of the datasets will be determined which will allow for the widespread identification of species, strains, genes and transcripts associated with dental caries and dental health.

Traditional methods of profiling microbes and metabolites could barely show any significant features due to the existence of large interindividual differences, but our novel microbe-metabolite correlation approach, combined with fecal IgA measurements, has revealed that the induction of mucosal IgA by FOS supplementation correlated with the presence of specific bacteria. Furthermore, the metabolic dynamics of butyrate, L-phenylalanine, L-lysine and tyramine were positively correlated with the dynamics of these bacteria and IgA production, whereas p-cresol was negatively correlated.

Here we show that colonic transit time in humans, assessed using radiopaque markers, is associated with overall gut microbial composition, diversity and metabolism. We find that a long colonic transit time associates with high microbial richness and is accompanied by a shift in colonic metabolism from carbohydrate fermentation to protein catabolism as reflected by microbial metabolites in urine, which results in a number of deleterious protein-derived metabolites. Additionally, longer colonic transit time correlates with metabolites reflecting reduced renewal of the colonic mucosa.

Interestingly, these studies have described how helminths may alter the intestinal microbiota, potentially representing a mechanism by which they regulate inflammation. However, for practical reasons, these reports have primarily analysed the fecal microbiota. In the present investigation, we have assessed, for the first time, the changes in the microbiota at the site of infection by a parasitic helminth (hookworm) and gluten-dependent inflammation in humans with CeD using biopsy tissue from the duodenum.

Despite the pathological mechanisms are still unclear, studies have shown that HAEC has close relationship with intestinal microbiota disturbance. This study aimed to investigate the characterization of the intestinal microbiome of HD with or without enterocolitis. During routine or emergency surgery we collected 35 intestinal content samples from five patients with HAEC and eight HD patients, including three HD patients with a history of enterocolitis (HAEC remission, HAEC-R). Using Illumina-MiSeq high-throughput sequencing, we sequenced the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined by 97% sequence similarity. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of weighted UniFrac distances was performed to compare the diversity of each intestinal microbiome sample. The microbiota differed significantly between the HD patients (characterized by Bacteroidetes) and HAEC patients (characterized by Proteobacteria), and the microbiota of HAEC-R patients was more similar to that of HAEC patients. We also observed that specimens from different intestinal sites in each HD patient differed significantly, whilst specimens from different intestinal sites in each HAEC and HAEC-R patients were more similar. In conclusion, the microbiome pattern of HAEC-R patients was more similar to that of HAEC patients than HD patients. HD patients have a relatively distinct, more stable community than HAEC and HAEC-R patients, suggesting that enterocolitis may either be caused by or result in a disruption of the patients uniquely adapted intestinal flora.

Some changes are even found in anatomic locations remote from where these helminths reside and may persist after helminth clearance. However, studies in humans have produced varied conclusions and the impact appears to vary widely depending on the helminth species present. To demonstrate how molecular approaches to the human gut microbiome can provide insights into the complex interplay among disparate organisms, DNA was extracted from cryopreserved stools collected from residents of 5 rural Kenyan villages prior to, 3 weeks and 3 months following albendazole (ALB) therapy. Samples were analyzed by qPCR for the presence of 8 species of intestinal parasites, and by MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Based on pre-treatment results, the presence of neither Ascaris lumbricoides (Al) nor Necator americanus (Na) infection significantly altered the overall diversity of the microbiota in comparison with age-matched controls. Following ALB therapy and clearance of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), there were significant increases in the proportion of the microbiota made up by Clostridiales (p=0.0002, average fold change 0.57), and reductions in the proportion made up by Enterobacteriales (p=0.0004, average fold change -0.58). There were additional changes in the microbiota that appear to be related to ALB administration, suggesting that these antimicrobial effects must be considered in any post-treatment setting. Nevertheless, the helminth-associated changes in Clostridiales and Enterobacteriales suggest that clearance of STH, and Na in particular, alters the gut microbiota.

Dysbiosis has been studied extensively but typically characterized cross-sectionally and as alterations in bacterial taxonomic proportions.  The longitudinal contributions of diet, antibiotic use, and inflammation on the evolution of dysbiosis during therapy for Crohn's disease have not been well characterized. Here we used shot-gun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples collected from a longitudinal prospective cohort of pediatric Crohn's disease subjects to analyze the representation and gene content of all types of organisms present, including bacteria, fungi, archaea and viruses.  Patients initiated treated with either antibodies directed against tumor necrosis factor alpha or enteral nutrition per the treating physician.  Multivariate analysis showed that microbiome composition was associated with three environmental stressors--intestinal inflammation, antibiotic use, and diet.  Bacterial gene signatures suggested that communities in Crohn's samples were responding to oxidative stress. Antibiotic use was associated with a more dysbiotic composition of the bacterial microbiota as well as a distinctive increase in fungal organisms and human DNA content. In contrast, the abundance of tailed phage and archaea was similar in feces of children with Crohn's disease and healthy controls.  Composition of the bacterial and fungal communities were highly correlated. Dysbiosis in bacterial and fungal communities was reduced in patients with reduction of intestinal inflammation by either therapy. Diet had an independent and rapid effect on gut microbiota composition within one week of initiation. Evidently dysbiosis characteristic of Crohn's disease results in part from inflammation and antibiotic use, and involves correlated changes in bacterial and eukaryotic community members.  Notably, the three stressors were independently associated with different bacteria and different gene pathways, reflecting concurrent disruption of normal homeostasis by multiple mechanisms. Thus, while dysbiosis in general is common to multiple disease states, the nature of the dysbiosis is unique to the environmental stressor.","Inflammation, Antibiotics, and Diet as Concurrent Environmental Stressors of the Gut Microbiome in Pediatric Crohn's Disease",HARVESTED,2019-05-14T09:59:32,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004728

However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo, demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured a person-, region- and microbial-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by differential baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, highly-individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches.Abstract (2):Probiotics are widely prescribed for prevention of antibiotics-associated dysbiosis and related adverse effects. However, probiotic impact on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut mucosal host-microbiome niche remains elusive. We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa, but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently-incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and gut transcriptome recovery to steady-state configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In-vitro, Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition. Collectively, potential post-antibiotic probiotic benefits may be offset by a compromised microbiome and host recovery, highlighting a need of developing aFMT or personalized probiotic approaches achieving mucosal protection, without compromising microbiome recolonization in the antibiotics-perturbed host.",(1) Personalized microbiome and host features resist gut mucosal colonization by empiric probiotics; (2) Post-antibiotic gut mucosal microbiome reconstitution is impaired by probiotics and improved by autologous FMT,SUBMITTED,2019-05-08T11:37:39,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00004712

In the study, we applied an unbiased sequencing approach to lung sputum samples in order to gain a more complete picture of the lung microbiome. We explored changes in the lung microbiome composition over time, particularly during exacerbations and antibiotic treatments. Moreover, we distinguished between evolution of internal strains and introduction of external strains from the environment. To do this, we followed four CF patients displaying extreme clinical phenotypes over the course of two years. During each exacerbation or routine clinical visit, the lung sputum from these patients was taken for shotgun sequencing. Reads not mapping to the host were subjected to assembly, taxonomic profiling, strain typing, and variant analysis. Sequencing revealed the presence of several microbes missed by culture, particularly anaerobes. It allowed us to identify dominant strains of abundant microbes, and to correct mistakes in taxonomic assignment from culture.

However, information collected to date varies across experiments, and further studies are needed to identify consistent relationships between parasites and commensal microbial species. Here, we explore the qualitative and quantitative differences between the microbial community profiles of cohorts of human volunteers from Sri Lanka with patent infection by one or more parasitic nematode species (H+), as well as that of uninfected subjects (H-) and of volunteers who had been subjected to regular prophylactic anthelmintic treatment (Ht). High-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, followed by bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of sequence data revealed no significant differences in alpha diversity (Shannon) and richness between groups (P = 0.65, P = 0.13 respectively); however, beta diversity was significantly increased in H+ and Ht when individually compared to H-volunteers (P = 0.04). Among others, bacteria of the families Verrucomicrobiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae showed a trend towards increased abundance in H+, whereas the Leuconostocaceae and Bacteroidaceae showed a relative increase in H- and Ht respectively. Our findings add valuable knowledge to the vast, and yet little explored, research field of parasite – microbiota interactions and will provide a basis for the elucidation of the role such interactions play in pathogenic and immune-modulatory properties of parasitic nematodes in both human and animal hosts.",Infections by human gastrointestinal helminths are associated with changes in faecal microbiota diversity and composition,SUBMITTED,2018-10-04T11:23:20,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003147

School-age children were screened for  the presence of STH infections and allocated to one of 3 groups:  uninfected, T. trichiura only, and mixed infections with T. trichiura  and Ascaris lumbricoides. A sample of uninfected children and those with  T. trichiura infections only were treated with albendazole (800 mg/day  for 3 days) and ivermectin (single dose of 200 ug/kg), and stool samples were collected 3 weeks post-treatment. Bacterial DNA was extracted using the FastDNA Spin kit for soil, and bacterial community profiles were  studied by 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes. This generated 999,796  sequences, which were processed and analysed using mothur.  Results: Microbiota analyses were done using stool samples from 97  children aged 8-14 years of whom 30 were not infected, 17 were infected  with T. trichiura alone, and 50 had mixed infections with both T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides. Post-treatment samples were analyzed for  14 of the 17 children initially infected with T. trichiura alone and 21  of 30 uninfected children. Treatment resulted in 100% cure of STH  infections. Comparisons of the microbiota at different taxonomic levels  showed no statistically significant differences in composition between  uninfected children and those with T. trichiura infections. A surprising  finding was a decreased proportional abundance of a few bacterial genera  from the clostridia class of Firmicutes, in tandem with a reduced  overall bacterial diversity, among children with mixed infections  compared to either uninfected children or those with T. trichiura  infections only, indicating a specific effect of A. lumbricoides  infection on intestinal microbiota.  Anthelmintic treatment of children  with T. trichiura did not appear to alter composition of faecal microbiota.  Discussion: This is the first molecular study to analyse the effect of  whipworm infection on the human intestinal microbiota. Our data indicate  that T. trichiura infections alone have no effect on the faecal  microbiota of children living in endemic communities, but that A.  lumbricoides colonisation might be associated with a disturbed  microbiota. Our results also catalogue the microbiota that is present in  rural Ecuadorians, and indicate that there are differences between this  cohort and individuals from more urban, industrialised societies.",Human_infections_with_the_whipworm__Trichuris_trichiura__are_not_associated_with_alterations_in_the_faecal_microbiota_,SUBMITTED,2018-09-19T09:49:46,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00003135

A microbial element of the condition has been confirmed, however exact aetiology remains enigmatic and ‘typical' microbiota development remains undefined. To characterise establishment of the severely preterm infant gut microbiota we employed targeted sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Sample types included oral and endotracheal swabs, stool and breast milk, collected from 7 patients over the first 2 months, postnatally (n = 158 samples). Propidium monoazide treatment was combined with targeted sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to identify viable bacterial communities. Significantly lower alpha diversity was observed in stool than upstream mucosae (P < .005). Homogenising dispersal of dominant taxa was identified across all body-sites within the first week of life and persisted throughout the sampling period for all infants. Beta diversity was lowest immediately following birth and between proximal sampling sites. Oral microbiota showed the greatest similarity to stool (R2 = .73, P < 0.05), however the composition of stool microbiotas diverged from upstream mucosae over time (67% at WoL 1 vs 20% at WoL 8).

Host-microbe interactions are highly relevant in patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, (HSCT), i.e. a replacement of the cellular part of the patients' immune system with that of a foreign donor. HSCT is employed as curative immunotherapy for a number of non-malignant and malignant hematologic conditions, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The procedure can be accompanied by severe side effects such as infections, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and death. Here, we performed a longitudinal analysis of immunological markers, immune reconstitution and gut microbiota composition in relation to clinical outcomes in children undergoing HSCT. Such an analysis could reveal biomarkers, e.g. at the time point prior to HSCT, that in the future could be used to predict which patients are of high risk in relation to side effects and clinical outcomes and guide treatment strategies accordingly.   Results: In two multivariate analyses (sparse partial least squares regression and canonical correspondence analysis), we identified three consistent clusters: (1) High concentrations of the antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (hBD2) prior to the transplantation in patients with high abundances of Lactobacillaceae, who later developed moderate or severe aGvHD and exhibited high mortality. (2) Rapid reconstitution of NK and B cells in patients with high abundances of obligate anaerobes such as Ruminococcaceae, who developed no or mild aGvHD and exhibited low mortality. (3) High inflammation, indicated by high levels of C-reactive protein, in patients with high abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, we observed that antibiotic treatment influenced the bacterial community state.  Conclusions: We identify multivariate associations between specific microbial taxa, host immune markers, immune cell reconstitution and clinical outcomes in relation to HSCT. Our findings encourage further investigations into establishing longitudinal surveillance of the intestinal microbiome and relevant immune markers, such as hBD2, in HSCT patients. Profiling of the microbiome may prove useful as a prognostic tool that could help identify patients at risk of poor immune reconstitution and adverse outcomes, such as aGvHD and death, upon HSCT, providing actionable information in guiding precision medicine.",Specific gut microbiome members are associated with distinct immune markers in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,SUBMITTED,2018-06-29T08:41:19,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Circulatory system:Blood', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Circulatory%20system:Blood'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002447

As sequencing costs continues to decrease, thorough investigations of the microbiome in the GI tract is now easily accessible. However, several studies have shown large variation between the mucosal and fecal microbiome in humans. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the mucosal microbiome is considered to be the most relevant for the pathogenesis. Mucosal tissue is only accessible during colonoscopy or surgery, and the availability of colon or ileum tissue is therefore the most important limiting factor in microbiome research in IBD. However the access to FFPE-tissue is immense compared to the availability of fresh tissue samples. Aims and methods: To compare the yield from 16srRNA sequencing on frozen tissue vs. FFPE from the same patient. Two patients scheduled for bowel resection because of cancer in the right hemicolon were included in this pilot study. Paired tissue biopsies were taken from the colon and ileum in both patients immediately after surgical bowel resection. One biopsy in the pair was frozen on liquid nitrogen and in -80 C and the other put on formalin for subsequent DNA isolation and sequencing analysis. DNA isolation were performed using Qiagen, QIAamp DNA mini kit for the frozen the tissue and Qiagen, QIAamp DNA FFPE tissue kit for FFPE tissue. 16srRNA sequencing, using Illumina Miseq platform were performed on both frozen tissue and FFPE tissue.",Pilot study comparing yield from 16srRNA sequencing from frozen tissue vs. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from the ileum and colon,SUBMITTED,2018-06-12T12:23:53,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002408

Previous studies have found large inter-individual variations in mucosal 5-ASA concentrations. Several explanatory models have been proposed, but is remains unintelligible why some patients have high 5-ASA concentrations, while others have low. Previous findings suggest that treatment with Asacol (pH-dependent release formulation) yields higher mucosal 5-ASA concentrations than Pentasa (time-dependent release formulation). The mucosal bacterial composition and fermentation products, such as short chain fatty acids, greatly impact pH-value in the colon and might therefore be correlated to 5-ASA concentration. Aim and method: In this cross-sectional non-randomized study, we have measured mucosal concentration of 5-ASA and its inactive metabolite acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) in the left hemicolon and rectum in patients with quiescent UC taking Mezavant, Asacol or Pentasa. Patients with quiescent UC using oral mesalazine monotherapy in the maximal dose recommended by the manufacturers (4.0-4.8g o.d.) were included. Eight hours after ingestion of mesalazine, patients underwent blood sample collection, followed by bowel preparation with enema and sigmoidoscopy. A total of six mucosal biopsies were collected 10, 25 and 40 cm from the anal verge. 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA concentrations were measured in five biopsies and serum by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mucosal and fecal microbiome was explored using 16srRNA sequencing.

The development of techniques to exploit samples, which cannot be satisfactorily analysed at present, is driving the field.  High-throughput sequencing techniques have been available for a few years however there are very few examples of their application in forensic science.   This study investigates the potential for bacteria found in the salivary microbiome to be used in a new method for human identification. Two different targets (16S RNA and rpoB) were chosen to maximise coverage of the salivary microbiome and when combined, they increase the power of identification. Paired-end Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to analyse the bacterial composition of saliva from two different people at four different time points (t=0 and t=28 days and then one year later at t=0 and t=28 days).   Five major phyla dominate the samples: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. Streptococcus, a firmicute, is one of the most abundant genera found in saliva and targeting Streptococcus rpoB has enabled a deeper characterisation of the different streptococci species otherwise impossible with 16S rRNA alone.

Reduced saliva flow may lead to changes in the salivary microbiota. These changes have mainly been studied with culture that typically recovers only 65% of the bacteria present.  Objective: This study was to use high throughput sequencing, covering both cultivated and not-yet-cultivated bacteria, to assess the bacterial microbiota of whole saliva in pSS patients with normal salivation.  Methods: Bacteria of whole unstimulated saliva from nine pSS patients with normal salivation flow and from nine healthy controls were examined by high throughput sequencing of the hypervariable region V1V2 of 16S rRNA using the 454 GS Junior system. Raw sequence reads were subjected to a species-level, reference-based taxonomy assignment pipeline specially designed for studying the human oral microbial community. Each of the sequence reads was BLASTN-searched against a database consisting of reference sequences representing 1,156 oral and 12,013 non-oral species. Unassigned reads were then screened for high-quality non-chimeras and subjected to de novo species-level operational taxonomy unit (OTU) calling for potential novel species. Downstream analyses, including alpha and beta diversities, were analyzed using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline. To reveal significant differences between the microbiota of control saliva and Sjögren's saliva, a statistical method introduced in Metastats www.metastats.cbcb.umd.edu was used.  Results: Saliva of pSS patients with normal salivation had a significantly higher frequency of Firmicutes compared with controls (p=0.004). Two other major phyla, Synergistetes and Spirochaetes, were significantly depleted in pSS (p=0.001 for both). In addition, we saw a nearly 17% decrease in the number of genera in pSS (25 vs. 30). While Prevotella was almost equally abundant in both groups (25% in pSS and 22% in controls), about a twofold increase in pSS of Streptococcus (28% vs. 17%) and Veillonella (26% vs. 12%) was detected. Prevotella melaninogenica was the major species in controls (13%) while Veillonella atypica and the Veillonella parvula groups dominated in patient samples (14 and 14%). The scarcity in bacterial species in pSS compared with controls was also demonstrated by alpha and beta diversity analyses, as well as read abundance depicted in a phylogenetic tree.  Conclusions: While Firmicutes was significantly higher in pSS patients than in controls, Synergistetes and Spirochaetes were significantly lower. The number of bacterial genera and species was also lower.

These infections are polymicrobial with high bacterial diversity.  Understanding the spatial transition of microbiota from normal oral cavities through the infected root canal to the acute periapical abscess can improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of endodontic infections and lead to more effective treatment. We obtained samples from the oral cavity, infected root canal and periapical abscess of 8 patients (5 with localized and 3 with systemic infections). Microbial populations in these samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons. Bioinformatics tools and statistical tests with rigorous criteria were used to elucidate the spatial transition of the microbiota from normal to diseased sites. Results: On average, 10,000 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from each sample.  All sequences fell into 11 different bacterial phyla.  The microbial diversity in root canal and abscess samples was significantly lower than in the oral samples.  Streptococcus was the most abundant genus in oral cavities while Prevotella and Fusobacterium were most abundant in diseased samples.  Root canal and periapical abscess microbiota were more similar to each other than to the oral cavity microbiota. Using rigorous criteria and novel bioinformatics tools, we found that Granulicatella adiacens, Eubacterium yurii, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella salivae, Streptococcus mitis, and Atopobium rimae were over-represented in diseased samples.  Conclusions: We used a novel approach and high-throughput methodologies to describe microbial transition from normal to diseased oral sites in the same individuals    Eight patients with root canal infections (5 with systemic infections and 3 with localized infection) undergone treatment.

However, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem, which may affect our ability to discover disease-associated biomarkers. In this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. We then sequenced the salivary and buccal mucosa bacterial communities of five healthy subjects to investigate their diversity and differences within and between subjects. Mock community analysis revealed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities revealed 455 OTUs (0.3% dissimilarity) across all samples with only 78 of the OTUs present in all subjects. Salivary communities were more diverse, with 120-318 OTUs per subject, while in mucosa each subject had 63-136 OTUs. Total OTUs per subject estimated using CatchAll (an estimator that performed well in evenly distributed salivary and also in uneven mucosal communities), ranged from 145-369 for saliva and 111-377 for mucosa. Inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident even at very low sequencing depths and were mainly explained by an over-representation of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa, while several taxa from the genera Neisseria, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, among others, showed higher affinity for saliva.

Significant decreases in abundance of these phyla were observed for pre-cancers, but not when comparing samples from contralateral sites (tongue and floor of mouth) from healthy individuals.  Weighted UniFrac principal coordinates analysis based on 12 taxa separated most cancers from other samples with greatest separation of node positive cases.

Culture- and PCR-based assays for specific microbes require the a priori selection of targets, while antibiotic sensitivity testing typically provides no insight into either the molecular basis of resistance, or the carriage of resistance determinants by the wider commensal microbiota. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing provides an alternative approach that allows the microbial composition of clinical samples to be described in detail, including the prevalence of resistance genes and virulence traits. While highly informative, the application of metagenomics to large patient cohorts can be prohibitively expensive. Using sputum samples from a randomised placebo-controlled trial of erythromycin in adults with bronchiectasis, we describe a novel, cost-effective strategy for screening patient cohorts for changes in resistance gene prevalence. By combining metagenomic screening of pooled DNA extracts with validatory quantitative PCR-based analysis of candidate markers in individual samples, we identify population-level changes in the relative abundance of specific macrolide resistance genes.

The effects of yoga or LFD intervention on the gut microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome was examined for correlations between both treatment options.Methods: Fifty-nine patients with IBS undertook a single-blind, randomized controlled trial involving a yoga or LFD intervention. Bacterial abundance was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing at baseline and after 12 weeks using operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Results: LFD resulted in reduction of the overall relative abundance of Firmicutes, especially of the genus Blautia. This was matched by an increase in the relative abundance of bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. This observation appears also as a weak, but not statistically significant trend in the yoga group. Few OTUs showed a similar response to yoga and LFD. The most pronounced was a decrease observed in the family Lachnospiraceae, namely Eubacterium hallii, Blautia wexlerae and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans.Conclusions: This study suggests that both, yoga and LFD can change the microbiota for some OTUs in a similar way. The reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes in LFD might unfold its effects through a direct change in the gut bacteria composition. In constrast, yoga might indirectly act on the microbiome through the parasympathetic nervous system, which paralleled the effects of LFD for some Lachnospiraceae species.

No significant correlations were found between wound duration or healing status and the abundance of any particular taxa, while wound size was positively correlated with the dominant skin Staphylococcus.   Conclusions: The major difference observed in this study of the skin microbiome associated with diabetes was a significant reduction in diversity.

Although the success of FMT requires donor bacteria to engraft in the patient's gut, the forces governing bacterial engraftment in humans are unknown. Here, we use a vast, ongoing clinical experiment - the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection with FMT - to uncover the rules of engraftment in humans. First, we built a machine learning model that accurately predicts which bacterial species will engraft in a given host. We then developed a maximum-likelihood strain inference method, Strain Finder, allowing us to infer the genotypes of donor strains and to track them through patients' guts over time. Surprisingly, engraftment could be predicted largely from the abundance and phylogeny of bacteria in the donor and the pre-FMT patient. We also found that donor strains within a species engraft in an all-or-nothing manner and that previously undetected strains frequently colonize the patient after FMT. We validated these findings in another disease context, metabolic syndrome, suggesting that the same principles of engraftment extend to other indications. These findings may guide the design of bacterial therapeutics that target diseases ranging from ulcerative colitis to cancer.",16S data from FMT trial for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection,SUBMITTED,2017-11-27T09:21:41,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002064/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002064/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002064/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002064/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002064/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002064/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00002064

In this study, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and two different bioinformatics approaches, to investigate possible changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in samples from patients with STEC infection compared to healthy and healed controls, collected during an outbreak caused by a STEC O26:H11 infection. Regardless of the bioinformatic procedure used, a good resolution of the taxonomic profiles of the samples was achieved. The faeces collected from the STEC infected patients showed a lower intestinal abundance of the beneficial microorganisms Bifidobacterium and Clostridiales spp. in comparison to controls where those microorganisms predominated. These differences were observed with both bioinformatic approaches used and seemed to be related with the STEC infection although the variation in the relative abundance of the members of the Bifidobacterium genus could have also been associated with the dysbiotic status following the diarrhoea.Finally, the metagenomic sequencing allowed to identify in the STEC positive samples, all the virulence traits present in the genomes of the STEC O26 that caused the outbreak.

Our primary objective is totrack the diversity and dynamics of bacterial communities within or between the patients, and to determine whether antibiotic therapy and adrenal corticosteroids treatment might influence the harbor of human bacterial pathogens..  Methods: The samples were obtained from eight patients of ventilator with endotracheal tube from Peking University People's Hospital in Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) during a period of 15 days. The microbiota of tracheal aspirates samples from day0, 1, 3, 5,7,10 and 14 were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing. The primers: 341F and 805R, complemented with 454 adapters and sample specific barcodes were used for PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA genes.   Results: Analysis of 736,495 high-quality sequences (92,061 reads per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. The composition of microbiota species were significantly distinguished between the day0 and the day14 of tracheal aspirate samples (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae). On the individual basis, the microbiota was, however, relatively stable over time. Treatment with antibiotics and adrenal corticosteroids indeed influenced the global composition of the microbiota. CONCLUSION: These results support the phenomenon of dynamics diversification of airway microbiota  in ventilated patients with tracheal intubation.

SkinSuit is a lightweight compression suit designed to provide head-to-foot (axial) loading to counteract spinal elongation during spaceflight. As synthetic garments may impact negatively on the skin microbiome, we used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon procedures to define bacterial skin communities at sebaceous and moist body sites of five healthy male volunteers undergoing SkinSuit evaluation. Each volunteer displayed a diverse, distinct bacterial population at each skin site. Short (8 h) periods of dry hyper-buoyancy flotation wearing either gym kit or SkinSuit elicited changes in the composition of the skin microbiota at the genus level but had little or no impact on community structure at the phylum level or the richness and diversity of the bacterial population. We also determined the composition of the skin microbiota of an astronaut during pre-flight training, during an eight-day visit to the International Space Station involving two 8 h periods of SkinSuit wear, and for one month after return. Changes in composition of bacterial skin communities at five body sites were strongly linked to changes in geographical location.

However, a placebo-controlled dietary advice study has not been conducted and the diet leads to a potentially detrimental shift in microbiota composition.Methods: A 2x2 factorial trial was undertaken in the tertiary care setting. Patients aged 18-65 years with Rome III IBS were recruited. Patients were randomised 1:1 for four weeks to a diet (sham diet vs LFD) and supplement (placebo vs probiotic), resulting in four different groups. The sham diet was equivalent in dietary restriction compared with LFD. The probiotic was multistrain (VSL#3). Patients were masked to the interventions. The primary endpoints were adequate relief of symptoms and stool Bifidobacteria abundance at four weeks. Results: 104 patients were randomised. 27 were allocated to sham diet/placebo, 26 to sham diet/probiotic, 24 to LFD/placebo and 27 to LFD/probiotic. There was no interaction between the interventions. In the intention-to-treat analysis, adequate symptom relief was higher for LFD (57%) versus sham (38%), although did not reach statistical significance (p=0.051), whereas in the per protocol analysis the higher proportion for LFD (61%) versus sham (39%) was statistically significant (p=0.043).

It is important to develop approaches to accurately and rapidly diagnose the types and stages of respiratory disease.  Many approaches are focusing on such as serum or sputum as the basis of a screening programme. Many biomolecules found within human saliva have their origins in the circulatory system and thus, saliva offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for a number of diseases.  In this study, we assessed how far saliva could be used to reveal key changes. In particular, we have used metabolomics whereby the chemical components of a sample (1000s of biochemicals) can be accurately quantified in a matter of minutes – to assess salvia samples from 93 samples. Saliva has also been used as a biofluid for metabolomics previously used to identify specific oral, breast and pancreatic cancer profilesThe sampled population encompassed 53 COPD patients from Prince Phillip, Gwangli and Bronglais Hospitals in the Hywel Dda Health Board Area. These consisted of 38 age-matched volunteer controls, 8 lung cancer patients and 18 with a range of respiratory diseases.  The samples consisting of 50 L of saliva were analysed using metabolomic approaches involving the use of Electrospray Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (FIE-MS) to produce a large dataset 169 samples x 6500 metabolites.  Application of “multivariate” statistical approaches allowed the identification of metabolites that are different in particular sample classes.   Using statistically approaches such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we demonstrate that saliva could distinguish between samples from each clinical classification compared to controls.  These results were validated using a cross-validated Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve which indicated a diagnostic accuracy of > 0.70. Individual chemicals which are the sources of variation between the sample sets have been identified. Further, we have discovered clear differences in the saliva metabolome of COPD patients at different disease severity as defined by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage classification.

This is true for young children when the gut microbiota is being assembled, as well as for adults.  Recent culture-independent analyses of the fecal microbiota of healthy Bangladeshi infants and children, sampled monthly from birth through the second year of life, have identified a group of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa that together define a normal program of postnatal development (maturation) of the gut microbiota. The acute voluminous diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae represents a dramatic example of enteropathogen invasion and gut microbial community disruption.  We have conducted a detailed time-series metagenomic study of the fecal microbiota during the acute diarrheal and recovery phases of cholera in a cohort of Bangladeshi adults living in an area with a very high burden of disease. Recovery is characterized by a pattern of accumulation of bacterial taxa that mirrors the normal pattern of assembly/maturation of the microbiota in healthy Bangladeshi children. To define underlying mechanisms, we created an artificial community of 14 sequenced human gut bacterial species in gnotobiotic mice, composed of taxa that directly correlate with recovery from cholera and that are indicative of normal microbiota maturation in healthy Bangladeshi children. One of these age-discriminatory species, Ruminococcus obeum, exhibited consistent increases in its relative abundance upon V. cholerae infection of the mice. Follow-up mono- and bi-colonization studies established that R. obeum restricts V. cholerae colonization. RNA-Seq of the community's meta-transcriptome, combined with assays of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) production and function, revealed that expression of R. obeum luxS (AI-2 synthase) and AI-2 production increase significantly with V. cholerae invasion, and that R. obeum AI-2 causes quorum-sensing mediated repression of toxin co-regulated pilus, a primary V. cholerae colonization factor. Co-colonization experiments in gnotobiotic mice established that R. obeum AI-2 reduces Vibrio colonization/pathogenicity through a novel pathway that does not depend on the canonical V. cholerae AI-2 sensor, LuxP.","Effects of cholera on the human gut microbiota, and interactions between human gut microbes and Vibrio cholerae.",SUBMITTED,2017-05-16T16:42:01,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00001748

The description of fungal organisms in breastmilk from healthy mothers is uncovered although the presence of fungal species has been reported in the human gut and in other mammalians? milk.  Methods  Breast milk samples from healthy lactating mothers (n=65) within 1 month after birth were analyzed. Fungal presence was confirmed by microscopy using fungal-specific fluorescent probes (FISH), isolation in culture media and isolates identification by specific ITS and 18S PCR and Sanger-sequencing.  Total fungal load was estimated by qPCR using fungal-specific primers, and the fungal composition was determined by 28S high-throughput rDNA sequencing. In addition, milk macronutrients and human somatic cells were also quantified by spectrophotometry and cytometry. ResultsUsing different culture media, we isolated 18 strains, whose ITS and 18S rDNA genes sequencing led to confirm the presence of viable fungal species. The qPCR data showed that 89% of the samples had detectable levels of fungal DNA, at an estimated median load of 4,1x105 cells/ml in colostrum, 4,5x105 cells/ml in transition milk and 2,8x105 cells/ml in mature milk samples. Pyrosequencing of the PCR-amplified 28S rDNA gene showed that the most common genera detected were Malassezia (44%), followed by Candida (19%) and Saccharomyces (12%). Nutrient analysis of the milk samples showed significant positive correlations of Malassezia presence with lactose content, and Candida presence with protein content. We also found a significant negative correlation between Lodderomyces genus and human somatic cells, as well as positive correlations of Cladosporium and Alternaria with bacterial load. ConclusionsIn this study we have detected the presence of viable fungal species in human breast milk.

To date, gut microbiome (as well as soil microbiome) is considered to be antibiotic resistance reservoir. The resistance can accumulate in the microbiome after antibiotic treatment against infectious agents, and it can be passed to pathogenic bacteria during further infections, even though absence of the target infection is checked after each therapy. Moreover, use of antibiotics in agriculture and every day life (without doctor’s recommendations) creates an environment for antibiotic resistance transfer between microbiomes, as there is always a selective pressure for it. That is a quite dangerous situation, as there is a permanent ubiquitous antibiotic resistance (AR) background. In the framework of the research available data on Russian and worldwide microbiomes (more than 2000 by 2015 year) will be analyzed and groups of patients who passed antibiotic treatment will be studied. Using obtained results a map of antibiotic resistance expansion will be created, dominating mechanisms of the resistance transfer and AR genes hosts will be revealed. Additionally, laboratory methods and mathematical analysis for genes’ and mechanisms’ screening will be developed. The developed models AR transfer will make possible modeling of various methods for AR transfer prevention, or, alternatively, modeling of consequences of different antibiotics’ use. Concluding, basic mechanisms of AR emergence will be described (6-1-3) and new methods of screening will be proposed.

Travel from the developed to the developing world in one subject led to a nearly two-fold increase in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio, which reversed upon return. Enteric infection in the other subject resulted in the permanent decline of most gut bacterial taxa, which were replaced by genetically-similar species. Still, even during periods of overall community stability, we could associate the dynamics of select microbial taxa to specific host behaviors.

This skin disease can affect the entire body surface, but primarily the lower extremities, with symptoms varying from nodules to ulcers. Secondary bacterial infections in open BU lesions are the main cause of pain, delayed healing and systemic illness, resulting in prolonged hospital stay. Thus understanding the diversity of bacteria in these open lesions is important for proper treatment. The normal skin flora is known to protect the host through commensal relationships, however, certain factors such as ulceration can shift the skin flora from being primarily commensal to potentially pathogenic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize and compare the skin bacteria from BU ulcers, non-BU ulcers, and similar locations on the skin of healthy individuals. Results: Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we determined the microbial composition of 5 BU lesions, 3 non-BU lesions and 3 healthy skin samples, and compared these using a data analysis pipeline. Our results showed a lower bacterial diversity in both the BU and non-BU lesions compared to the healthy skin. However, no significant differences were found between BU and non-BU lesions. The BU lesions were characterized by an increase of Bacteroidetes compared to the non-BU wounds, which contained more (Gamma)Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the BU lesions also contained significantly more obligate anaerobes. All lesions contained a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with more gram-negatives present in the BU and non-BU lesions than in healthy skin samples. With this molecular-based study, we were also able to detect bacteria, which were missed by culture-based methods in previous BU studies.Conclusions: Our study suggests that BU leads to changes in the bacterial community within the lesions. These changes are potentially detrimental and may cause a delay in the healing process.

Amount of studies have suggested the relationship between the microbiota and the onset of diseases, especially some chronic diseases. An understanding of bacterial community in the sputum from patients has deeply recognized the pulmonary tuberculosis.   Methods. We enrolled 31 patients suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and 24 healthy persons as the normal control, and then extracted the total DNA of sputum samples of pulmonary tuberculosis patients and respiratory secretions of normal person. 16S rDNA V3 hyper-variable regions were amplified using bar-coded primiers and pyro-sequenced using  Roche 454 FLX .   Results. All the sequences we get were analysed by tools in the Ribosomal Database Project. the amplicons were classified into 24 main phyla, there are 24 phylum in the pulmonary tuberculosis samples and 17 phylum in normal person. Microbiota changed in the sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients, and we can separate pulmonary tuberculosis patients from normal person through the respiratory microbial community. The microbial composition in the sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients is much more diversity than that in normal person(p<0.05). Furthermore, lots of foreign bacteria such as Stenotrophomonas, Cupriavidus, Pseudomonas, Thermus, Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Diaphorobacter, Comamonas and Mobilicoccus uniquely distributed in the pulmonary tuberculosis patients.   Conclusions. The study concludes that the respiratory tract microbial composition  in pulmonary tuberculosis become much more complicated than that in normal person.

In this study, we investigated vaginal microbial community composition and structure upon active Chlamydial infection and clearance of infection for 9 months after treatment, using a collection of samples from 101 young women. One striking findings is that the hallmark of healthy vagina Lactobacillus is markedly underrepresented in the investigated cohort, particularly L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, while the abundance of L. iners is similar to healthy or asymptomatic cohort. To make the results more comparable between different studies, we also compare 16S gene V1-V3 amplicon with V1-V2 amplicon in their taxonomic assignment. Furthermore, strong association of microbial community compositional profiling and pathological conditions is revealed.

Examining baseline variation within and between individuals over time is critical to understanding this disease transition. Here we examined the temporal stability of supragingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and salivary microbial communities of healthy individuals. Ten subjects were sampled over 90 days and oral bacterial communities were profiled by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In all cases, supragingival plaque consortia were distinct from tongue dorsum and salivary communities. Overall, 97% of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in saliva were also detected in tongue samples, whereas only 2% of salivary OTUs were associated with supragingival plaque. Relative to other sites, the tongue dorsum also exhibited the highest relative temporal stability in bacterial composition. Because of the temporal variability in intra-individual microbiota, pooling of data from at least three time-points was required to capture the majority of an individual?s diversity at all time points. Using machine learning, we could also identify each subject by their microbial profiles alone with 95% accuracy, owing to each individual?s distinct oral microbial profiles. We also identified a core set of bacterial OTUs from all samples that classified within six genera: Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Prevotella, and Rothia. A set of 14 additional core OTUs were present in the majority of subjects, sites, and time-points, affiliated with the Campylobacter, Bergeyella, and Porphyromonas genera. This study characterizing a baseline and examining temporal shifts of the healthy core microbiota provides an useful prospect to examine dysbiosis during disease.

Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV subtypes is necessary for the development of invasive cervical cancer. Recent evidence indicates that the vaginal microbiome may play a functional role in the persistence or regression of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections. The vaginal microbiome in women with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) has yet to be investigated.  Objectives: To characterize the vaginal microbiome structure and diversity in women with different CIN grades.  Material and Methods:  Population: Reproductive age, non-pregnant women of reproductive age with CIN attending the colposcopy clinic. Setting: Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. Interventions: Vaginal swabs were collected from the posterior vaginal fornix and bacterial DNA extracted. The vaginal microbiome was characterised by 16S rRNA gene sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Women were categorized in to two groups on the basis of histology and cytology; women with low-grade (LSIL) and high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (HSIL). Analysis: Supervised, and unsupervised multivariate modeling of sequence data was used to examine bacterial species classification data, and correlated these to the disease severity. Richness and diversity indices were calculated for patient population groups.   Results: We analysed 39 women with CIN, which were divided in to LSIL (n=11) and HSIL (n=28) grades. Hierarchical clustering analysis of bacterial species data revealed 3 distinct community state types (CST I: Lactobacillus crispatus; CST III: Lactobacillus iners; CST IV: mixed diverse Lactobacillus-depleted microbiome) in women with CIN. 26% of our predominantly Caucasian population had a high-diversity, non-Lactobacillus dominated microbiome (CST IV), which is approximately 3 times greater than the rate documented for Caucasian women without CIN in previous reports. None of the women with CIN had a Lactobacillus gasseri-dominated (CST II). The proportion of women with CST IV vaginal microbiome was similar for women with LSIL (n=3 out of 11; 27%) versus women with HSIL (8 out of 28; 28%).  Conclusions: One third of women with CIN have a more diverse Lactobacillus-depleted vaginal microbiome, higher than the rates previously reported in normal populations. This high rate of microbiome diversity may reflect lesions that are likely to progress and warrants further investigation.

Historically, studies on the pregnant vaginal microbiome have been limited to Northern American populations. Using MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we characterised the vaginal microbiota of a mixed British ethnic cohort of women (n=42) who experienced normal, uncomplicated term delivery and whom were sampled longitudinally throughout pregnancy (8-12, 20-22, 28-30 and 34-36 weeks gestation) and the postpartum period (6 weeks) in. We show that the composition of the vaginal microbiome dramatically changes postpartum to become less Lactobacillus spp. dominant with greater alpha-diversity (CST IV) irrespective of the community structure for that individual during pregnancy and independent of their ethnic background. As observed in North American populations, a British population is characterised by a vaginal microbiome during pregnancy that is dominated by Lactobacillus spp. and low alpha-diversity (community state types CST I, II and III). However, significant numbers of women in this British cohort have an L. jensenii (CST V) dominated microbiome that is characterised by low levels of alpha-diversity. CST V was predominantly observed in women with Asian and Caucasian ethnic backgrounds whereas CST II (L. gasseri) was absent in samples collected from Black women. This study reveals new insights into biogeographical and ethnic effects upon the microbial communities in the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy and in the postpartum period and has important implications for future studies designed to explore relationships between the vaginal microbiome, host health and pregnancy outcomes.",The vaginal microbiome during pregnancy and the postpartum period in a European population.,HARVESTED,2016-05-16T11:45:05,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000942/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000942/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Reproductive system:Vagina', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Reproductive%20system:Vagina'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000942/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000942/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000942/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000942/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000942

However, it remains unclear to which extent oral iron administration affects the intestinal microbiome. Therefore, we here investigated the impact of multiple iron preparations and doses on the growth and metabolism of a human gut microbiota in a well-controlled in vitro model of the large intestine. Microbiome analysis showed clear iron-induced changes and prominent shifts included a decrease of Bifidobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae under iron-rich conditions, paralleled by an increase of  Roseburia and Prevotella. Metagenomic analyses showed a general enrichment of bacterial motility-chemotaxis systems under iron-rich conditions. Metabolome profiling showed that gut microbial activity markedly shifted from a saccharolytic to a proteolytic profile in response to iron. Levels of branched chain fatty acids and ammonia increased significantly, in particular under ferrous sulfate-rich conditions. Importantly, cell viability tests showed increased cytotoxicity of metabolite-containing effluent from iron-rich conditions. We also identified microbial metabolites with siderophoric activity that were specifically produced under low-iron conditions. Our data indicate that in the absence of host influences, iron induces a more hostile intestinal environment characterized by i) reduction of beneficial microbes and increase of certain bacterial species with pathogenic potential, ii) increased levels of bacterial metabolites that can impair the barrier function of the gut wall, and iii) increase of virulence-associated pathways of enteric pathogens.

Microbes living in and on humans are ten times more numerous than human cells. Culture-based methods have been the primary techniques used to study microbes inhabiting humans; however, many species are not successfully grown in culture. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aims to investigate the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, skin, vagina, and nares. The goal of the HMP is to comprehensively characterize the human microbiota and analyze its role in human health and disease.   The skin serves not only as a barrier against invading pathogens and moisture loss, but also as a host to microbial communities. The skin of an adult is an approximately 2 square meter surface with a myriad of microenvironments.  Atopic dermatitis (AD), more commonly known as eczema, is a common skin disorder that is exacerbated by Staphylococcus aureus colonization.  This study aims to investigate the skin microbiota of AD patients at specific timepoints (quiescence, disease flares, and post-treatment) to examine how disease state correlates with changes in the skin microflora.     The 16S small subunit ribosomal (rRNA) gene is present in every bacterial cell, serving as a universal marker. The gene is sufficiently conserved to allow accurate alignment but adequately varied to enable phylogenetic analyses. Sequencing via 16S rRNA-based phylotyping has been used to survey the bacterial microbes on the skin.  Initially, we will examine the bacterial diversity associated with AD using a 16S rRNA survey and later broadening to include fungi, viruses, archaea and mites. In addition, bacteria will be cultured on a wide variety of media and isolates representing both abundant and novel species will be selected for whole genome sequencing.  To characterize fungal diversity, we utilize two phylogenetic markers within the rDNA region: 18S rRNA and the Intervening Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region.

The current hypothesis is that these diseases are due to an overly aggressive immune response to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria. Studies to date on IBD have suggested that the disorder may be caused by a combination of bacteria and host susceptibility; however the etiologies of these diseases remain an enigma.  In this application, we propose to develop and demonstrate the ability to profile Crohn’s disease at an unprecedented molecular level by elucidation of specific biomarkers (bacterial strains, genes, or proteins) that correlate to disease symptoms. To achieve this goal, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach based on metagenomic and metaproteomic molecular tools to elucidate the composition of the commensal microbiota in monozygotic twins that are either healthy or exhibit Crohn’s disease (for concordant, both are diseased; for discordant, one is healthy and one is diseased).  The central hypotheses of this proposal are (1) that specific members and/or functional activities of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota differ in patients with Crohn’s disease as compared to healthy individuals, and (2) that it will be possible to elucidate microbial signatures which correlate with the occurrence and progression of this disease by integration of data obtained from 16S rRNA-based molecular fingerprinting, metagenomics, and metaproteomics approaches. To address these hypotheses, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Obtain data on community gene content (metagenome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn’s Disease to assess potential differences in the metabolic capabilities of the gut microbiota associated with CD, 2) Obtain data on community protein content (metaproteome) in a subset of healthy twins and twins with Crohn’s Disease to assess the state of expressed proteins associated with CD, 3) Apply various statistical clustering and classification methods to correlate/associate microbial community composition, gene and protein content with patient metadata, including metabolite profiles and clinical phenotype.  The ultimate goal of these efforts is to identify novel biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostics of CD and to eventually identify drug targets (i.e. bacterial strains) for cure or suppression of disease symptoms.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to unravel the contribution of the bacteria that normally inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract to Crohn’s disease by using a multidisciplinary approach to study changes in the structure and function of gut microbial communities in three sets of patient cohorts who have Crohn’s disease. These results will be compared with those obtained from the study of healthy individuals and have the potential to identify new biomarkers of disease severity, location, and progression.",Human Gut Microbiome in Crohn's Disease,HARVESTED,2016-01-20T14:12:06,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000277/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000277/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000277/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000277/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000277/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000277/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000277

We performed a 2.5-year case study of the assembly of the human infant gut microbiome to relate life events to microbiome composition and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ~500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present prior to the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome.

Here, we conducted, to the best of our knowledge, the first global comparative OMIC investigation of gut microbial communities in samples of an individual subjected to β-lactam antibiotic therapy at different time frames. Results indicated a drastic change of the total community at response to AB at the day 11thwhich correlated with changes at the level of metabolites, mRNA transcripts and production of proteins. By contrast, AB-resistant active microbiota remains constant, showing a relevant decrease three days later, which indicate an AB time-delay between total and active bacteria. Forty days after AB therapy, the total community is restored but, surprisingly, the low abundant bacteria (Proteobacteria) become the most active members. This is in agreement with unique metabolomic signatures which indicate that human-gut microbe interactions seem to be restored (or improved) as a consequence of AB therapy. It is worth to mention that as a consequence of AB a drastic under-expression of protein production and an attenuation of the metabolic status occurred irreversibly, in agreement with the biodiversity and richness decreased of the total microbiota. Most likely, at the initial stages, AB-resistant bacteria may become, albeit at lower numbers, the most active bacterial members, but their consequent instability as response to AB therapy produced a re-establishment of the overall community containing new active members that has a connection with the host.

At the start of the project, the fraction of mammalian and bacterial DNA in the sample was estimated to < 6% and 9%, respectively. Treatment with restriction enzymes prior to sequencing increased the relative proportion of mammalian DNA to 15%, but the large majority of sequences remain uncharacterized. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our taxonomic profiling based on the analyses of 3.95 Gb of Neandertal DNA isolated from the Vindija Neandertal Vi33.16 fossil showed that 90% of about 50,000 rRNA sequence reads were of bacterial origin and that actinobacteria accounted more than 75% of the bacterial rRNA sequences. Likewise, actinobacteria represented more than 80% of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA sequences from a cave sediment sample taken from the same G layer as the Neandertal bone. We assembled all 16S rRNA sequence read assigned to Streptomycetales, and analysed the patterns of nucleotide differences in the individual sequence reads compared to assembled consensus sequences. The typical ancient nucleotide substitution pattern with a majority of C to T changes indicative of DNA damage was observed for the Neandertal rRNA sequences, but not for the Streptomyces-like rRNA sequences. SIGNIFICANCE: Our analyses suggest that actinobacteria, and especially members of the Streptomycetales, contribute the majority of sequences in the DNA extracted from the Neandertal fossil Vi33.16. The bacterial DNA showed no signs of damage, and we hypothesize that it was derived from cave sediment bacteria that have been enriched inside the bone.

They spanned from a community structure similar to the normal control (predominated with Lactobacillus) to BV-like community structures (abundant with Gardnerella and Atopobium). Treatment of VVC showed inconsistent changes of vaginal microbiota, with four BV/VVC samples recovered to a higher Lactobacillus level while many VVC-only patients did not.

In a cohort of HIV-infected individuals on succesful antiretroviral therapy (ART) without comorbidities and in healthy controls we determined a number of systemic markers of innate and adaptive immunity. DNA was extracted from stool samples and amplicons of 16S rRNA and whole genome shot-gun sequences were analyzed, and the genus and pathways that characterized the microbiota of HIV-infected individuals were determined. HIV-infected subjects harbored a dysbiotic fecal microbiota, characterized by high levels of disease-associated bacteria, an increment of Gram-negative species and particularly by an abundance of Prevotella and Succinibivrio genera and a depletion of Bacteriodes and Faecalibaterium. This dysbiosis was related to an altered functional profile, including LPS biosynthesis ?a source for systemic inflammation?, glutathione metabolism, ?a bacterial mechanism to neutralize local oxidative stress?, and several inflammatory pathways. Using Bayesian network modeling, we determined that the dysbiotic bacterial community and the correlated altered metabolic pathways was associated with markers of immune dysfuntion, including impaired thymic output, heightened bactericidal-permeability increasing protein ?a marker of bacterial translocation and a severe predictor of severe coronary atherosclerosis-, soluble CD14 ?a marker of monocyte activation- and T-cell activation. Hence, the HIV-mediated breakdown of the gut mucosa is associated to a shift in the composition and function of gut microbiota that is not reverted by ART, even in subjects without comorbidities and optimal immunovirological response.

Recent studies suggest that gut bacterial communities influence how humans recover from infectious diarrhea, but we still lack extensive data and mechanistic hypotheses for how these communities respond to diarrheal disease and its treatment. Here, we report that after V. cholerae infection, human gut microbiota undergo an orderly and reproducible succession featuring transient reversals in relative levels of enteric Bacteroides and Prevotella. Elements of this succession may be a common feature in microbiota recovery from acute secretory diarrhea, as we observed similar successional dynamics after enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli  (ETEC) infection. Our metagenomic analyses suggest multiple mechanisms driving microbial succession after cholera, including bacterial dispersal properties, changing enteric oxygen and carbohydrate levels, and phage dynamics. Thus, gut microbiota recovery after cholera may be predictable at the level of community structure, but driven by a complex set of temporally varying ecological processes. Our findings suggest opportunities for diagnostics and therapies targeting the gut microbiota in humans recovering from infectious diarrhea.",Gut microbial succession follows acute secretory diarrhea in humans,SUBMITTED,2016-01-20T14:12:06,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000502/geocoordinates,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000502/biomes,"[{'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Fecal', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Fecal'}}, {'type': 'biomes', 'id': 'root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive system:Large intestine:Sigmoid colon', 'links': {'self': 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/biomes/root:Host-associated:Human:Digestive%20system:Large%20intestine:Sigmoid%20colon'}}]",https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000502/publications,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000502/samples,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000502/analyses,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000502/downloads,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/api/v1/studies/MGYS00000502

Laboratory diagnostic methods that allow effective, early detection of cases are central to management of tuberculosis in the individual patient and in the community. Since the 1880s, laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis has relied primarily on microscopy and culture. However, microscopy fails to provide species- or lineage-level identification and culture-based workflows for diagnosis of tuberculosis remain complex, expensive, slow, technically demanding and poorly able to handle mixed infections. We therefore explored the potential of shotgun metagenomics, sequencing of DNA from samples without culture or target-specific amplification or capture, to detect and characterise strains from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in smear-positive sputum samples obtained from The Gambia in West Africa. Eight smear- and culture-positive sputum samples were investigated using a differential-lysis protocol followed by a kit-based DNA extraction method, with sequencing performed on a benchtop sequencing instru- ment, the Illumina MiSeq. The number of sequence reads in each sputum-derived metagenome ranged from 989,442 to 2,818,238. The proportion of reads in each metagenome mapping against the human genome ranged from 20% to 99%. We were able to detect sequences from the M. tuberculosis complex in all eight samples, with coverage of the H37Rv reference genome ranging from 0.002X to 0.7X. By analysing the distribution of large sequence polymorphisms (deletions and the locations of the insertion element IS6110) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we were able to assign seven of eight metagenome-derived genomes to a species and lineage within the M. tuberculosis complex. Two metagenome-derived mycobacterial genomes were assigned to M. africanum, a species largely confined to West Africa; the others that could be assigned belonged to lineages T, H or LAM within the clade of ?modern? M. tuberculosis strains. We have provided proof of principle that shotgun metagenomics can be used to detect and characterise M. tuberculosis sequences from sputum samples without culture or target-specific amplification or capture, using an accessible benchtop-sequencing platform, the Illumina MiSeq, and relatively simple DNA extraction, sequencing and bioinformatics protocols. In our hands, sputum metagenomics does not yet deliver sufficient depth of coverage to allow sequence- based sensitivity testing; it remains to be determined whether improvements in DNA extraction protocols alone can deliver this or whether culture, capture or amplifica- tion steps will be required.
